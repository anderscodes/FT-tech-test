**This is a submission for the Financial Times technical test**

The instructions were to create a web page that used the Financial Times API to return a list of articles with a specific search term.

I have built my project using node and JavaScript with express as a web framework, EJS for templating, request to handle the API request, Jasmine and Cypress for testing and finally Eslint as a linter with the airbnb config for the style guide.
